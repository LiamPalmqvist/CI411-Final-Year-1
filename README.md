# This is basically just a project for my University degree

For those actually interested, I'm making a Touhou-like game based on some older Touhou games along with some other bullet hell games since the Touhou games were the ones that basically defined what a "Bullet Hell" game is.

Anyway, this is written almost entirely in C++ using a custom version of the SDL2 rendering library put together by a lecturer of mine.

Development on this game will most likely cease before the 12th of May 2023 as that's when this is due in.
